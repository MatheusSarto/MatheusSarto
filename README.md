# üëã Hi

My name is Matheus Sarto, software developer and technology and systems development enthusiast. I'm always looking for new knowledge and to improve on what I've already established. I'm very curious about game development!

# üíØ About me
I started studying development and the world of technology at a young age, currently I have main knowledge in languages such as JAVA, C# and C++. I have a degree in systems analysis and development from PUCPR, and have already had contact with different types of technologies and different knowledge during the course and in my experiences as a developer.

In my professional career, I have already developed more than two mobile applications using the flutter framework. I have no problem embracing responsibilities and leadership positions, guiding the team in the best possible way according to the needs of the project, using agile methodologies for the best organization of the team and the project.

As a small hobby, I sporadically participate in gamejams and small developments. I have already participated in the development of two games, only one of which was published and available for download, and this was a project carried out with an international team of developers.
